# HealthConnect

## The Challenge
Patients in rural areas often have to travel long distances to see specialists, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

## Our Solution
We developed a HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform featuring:
- **High-quality video consultations** using WebRTC.
- **Integrated electronic health records (EHR)**.
- **AI-powered symptom checker** for preliminary triage.

## The Results
- **10,000+** consultations conducted in the first 3 months.
- **98%** patient satisfaction rate.
- **Expanded access** to healthcare for over 50 remote communities.
