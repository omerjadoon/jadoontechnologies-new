# FinTech Revolution

## The Challenge
The client, a regional bank, was struggling with an outdated mobile app that was driving customers away. They needed a modern, secure, and intuitive solution to compete with digital-first banks.

## Our Solution
We designed and developed a native mobile application using React Native, focusing on:
- **Security**: Biometric authentication and end-to-end encryption.
- **User Experience**: A streamlined interface for common tasks like transfers and bill payments.
- **Performance**: Optimized API integrations for real-time transaction updates.

## The Results
- **4.8/5** App Store rating (up from 2.1).
- **200%** increase in daily active users.
- **30%** reduction in support tickets related to app usability.
