# EcoTrack

## The Challenge
Large corporations struggle to accurately measure and report their carbon emissions across complex supply chains.

## Our Solution
We built a cloud-based platform that:
- **Integrates** with existing ERP systems to collect data automatically.
- **Visualizes** carbon footprint data in real-time dashboards.
- **Recommends** actionable steps to reduce emissions based on AI analysis.

## The Results
- **15%** average reduction in carbon emissions for pilot clients.
- **50%** reduction in time spent on sustainability reporting.
- **Awarded** "Green Tech Innovation of the Year".
