## Project Overview

Our client faced challenges in handling a high volume of complex customer support queries that required multi-step reasoning and access to various internal data sources. We developed a multi-agentic system to automate these workflows, significantly reducing response times and improving accuracy.

## The Solution

We leveraged **LangChain** to orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific part of the support process (e.g., data retrieval, policy checking, response drafting). **Claude LLM** was chosen for its superior reasoning capabilities and long context window.

### Key Features

- **Specialized Agents:** Separate agents for technical support, billing, and general inquiries.
- **Tool Integration:** Agents can interact with CRM, knowledge bases, and order tracking systems.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Seamless escalation to human agents for highly sensitive or ambiguous cases.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain:** For agent orchestration and memory management.
- **Claude LLM (Anthropic):** The core reasoning engine.
- **Python:** For backend logic and integration.
- **Vector Database:** For efficient retrieval of relevant knowledge base articles.

## Results

- **60% Reduction** in average response time.
- **45% Automation Rate** for complex, multi-step queries.
- **Improved Customer Satisfaction** due to faster and more accurate resolutions.
